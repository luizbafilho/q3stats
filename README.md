#Q3Stats
----------------------------

It generates several webpages containing statistics about the games played from the games.log generated by a Quake3:Arena server.

#Getting Started
----------------------------

This app uses a Sinatra web server to show you the infos.

To initialize the app it is very easy:

1. git clone git@github.com:luizfilho/q3stats.git
2. bundle install
3. ruby sinatra

You can define the games.log filepath inside the log_parser.rb.
